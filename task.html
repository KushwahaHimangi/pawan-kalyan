        (2008), Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), Vakeel Saab (2021), and Bheemla

        produces films under the banners Anjana Productions and Pawan Kalyan Creative Works.[12]
        In 2008, Kalyan entered into politics as the youth wing president of his brother Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam
        Party, but he left after it merged into the Congress party. He founded the Jana Sena Party in March 2014 and was

        with the support of Pawan Kalyan Creative Works and Anjana Productions. As the head of the youth section of the
        Praja Rajyam Party, which his brother Chiranjeevi founded, Kalyan made his political debut in 2008. Following
        Chiranjeevi's decision to merge the party into the Congress party, he quit it. Kalyan established the Jana Sena
        Party in March 2014. Google recognized him at the time as the most popular Indian celebrity politician. He is

        One year after making his cinematic debut, in 1997, Kalyan married Nandini. Kalyan and his co-star Renu Desai
        began living together in 2001, and their son Akira Nandan was born in 2004. In magistrate court, Nandini filed a
        bigamy case against Kalyan in June 2007, accusing him that he had remarried his costar without divorcing her. In
        his response, Kalyan claimed that he had not married Desai. The magistrate court in Visakhapatnam had cleared
        him of all the accusations due to a lack of supporting evidence. After that, in July 2007, Kalyan filed for
        divorce at a family court in Visakhapatnam, alleging that Nandini had left him as soon as they were married.
        Nandini's attorney refuted Kalyan's claims. Their divorce was finalized in August 2008, with Kalyan paying
        alimony of 5 crores as a one-time settlement. After living together for eight years, Kalyan married Desai in
        2009. In 2010, their daughter Aadya was born. In 2012, the couple filed for divorce formally. In a 2018
        interview, Desai revealed that Kalyan "insisted on a divorce despite her initial protest,". She continued by
        saying that Kalyan had declined her wish to announce their divorce publicly. While filming Teen Maar, Kalyan met
        his third wife, Russian citizen Anna Lezhneva (2011). At a Hyderabad Sub-Registrar Office in September 2013,
        they got married following the Special Marriage Act. Mark Shankar Pawanovich is the son, and Polena Anjana
        Pawanova is the daughter of the pair. The Times of India reported on April 20, 2019, that a Tollywood actress
        said she was used, misled, and used while she was emotionally weak, likely referring to Pawan Kumar.

        Kalyan was born as Konidala Kalyan Babu[21] on 2 September[a] in a Telugu family to Konidala Venkata Rao and
        Anjana Devi in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh.[26][27] Venkata Rao worked as a police constable and was transferred on
        a regular basis.

        of his public martial arts presentations.[29] He also holds a black belt in Karate.
        Praja Rajyam Party
        Kalyan started his political career in 2008[60] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[61] the youth wing of Praja
        Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he
        hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party,
        he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke
        during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[62] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[63] with the
        Congress Party,[64] Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with his brother's
        decision to merge the party.[65]

        Jana Sena Party
        Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[66] He wrote a book titled Ism which is
        also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.[67] He met with then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime ministerial
        candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.[68] He
        campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He
        opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the
        Country' in Hindi).[69] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and
        Telangana.[70] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017
        once he completes his film commitments.[71]

        Kalyan brought the Uddanam kidney disease crisis to the attention of media and politicians through protests and
        a hunger strike. Government of Andhra Pradesh responded by constructing dialysis centers and implementing
        various schemes for the village.[72][73] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will contest in the
        2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh.[74] He stated that he was planning to contest from all 175
        legislatures of Andhra Pradesh without any alliance.[75] He opposed central government's move to privatise
        Dredging Corporation of India (DCI)[76] on a golden platter.[77] Kalyan led a protest march to condolence
        farmers who committed suicides or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[78] He opposed the TDP
        Government's decision on land pooling.[79] Kalyan conducted a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage in
        Rajahmundry demanding political accountability.[80] He exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve
        forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari district.[81]

        Kalyan has announced the Jana Sena party's 2019 election manifesto at Rajahmundry[82] public meeting with many
        measures to improve the lives of farmers,[83] farm labourers, women, youth, and students. His party would
        contest together with left parties[84] Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and Bahujan
        Samaj Party[85] for the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At the
        same time, when he was actively campaigning for the elections all around Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and shared
        a few health problems. As he was getting ready for his next round of campaign at Sattenapalle, he felt dizzy and
        nauseated. When the chopper was down for refilling at Gannavaram airport, he was down with vomiting,
        dehydration, and drowsiness. Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in Vijayawada. Again the campaign
        resumed after he got well.[86][87]

        The Jana Sena Party has contested 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections.
        Kalyan has contested two constituencies – Gajuwaka[88] and Bhimavaram.[89] He has lost in both to candidates
        from YSR Congress Party.[90] His party was able to win from Razole, making it the only seat it has won in the
        election.[91]

        Later the same year, on 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction
        workers against YSR Congress Party governance who have been facing unemployment due to shortage of supply of
        sand in Andhra Pradesh.[92]

        On 16 January 2020, Kalyan has announced his party's alliance with BJP, after three years of distancing from it.
        Both the parties fought together in elections of 2024.[93] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to
        Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[94] He demanded an inquiry by Central
        Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[95]

        The Jana Sena Party contested 21 constituencies in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, with
        Kalyan contesting in Pithapuram constituency. He won by a margin of more than 70,000 votes; Jana Sena Party won
        in all the contested twenty-one assembly constituencies and two Lok Sabha seats.[96]

        On 12 June 2024 Kalyan was sworn in as a cabinet minister of Andhra Pradesh, whereas on 16 June 2024, he was
        announced as the deputy chief minister.[97]
